Question:  What are the scenarios to select instance variable, static variable and local variable?
		//Using instance variables, when we are dealing with many instances of a object. These instances of a object independently change the value of their own adopted variables without changing the value of original instance variables.
		//Using static variables, when we want them to be accessed by all methods in the class without initiating an instance of a object , and for faster execution and save memory (because it is stored in class/method area in memory, and only one static member needs to maintained) 
		//Using local variables, when we don't want them to be accessed by any other methods in the class, except the method itself.
